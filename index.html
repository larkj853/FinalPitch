>I want my final to center around film. In other words, I want to create a film database of sorts. Beyond that, however, its still quite a bit fuzzy. The following are potential databases Im interested in curating: queer films, Asian American films, films that are pre-Hays codes (a series of censorship guidelines imposed by the MPAA during the 1920s) or that subvert the codes during their reign, or some other type of catalog I have yet to think of. In any case, I want to create a reference in p5.js that serves to highlight under-told stories. 

<br> As I said earlier, I am still quite uncertain about which direction I want to take this project. I do want to make sure the user can filter by genre / intended emotional experience / average rating and that it is intended to be an homage to the independent film world. I want this to be an accessible form of media, one that appeals to those who dont necessarily fall into the direct target audience these films intend on reaching.

<br> In terms of execution, I know I will need a pretty artful layout to make it enticing. However, I am also confused about the parameters of the final (i.e. how to use 1,000 sources). Given the nature of my project, I am uncertain that there will be enough places to pull from to meet this section of the criteria. I can always access archives, but I dont know how to facilitate the process of screening for 1,000 sources. I am also unsteady with website creation at large, at least the kind we most recently used in class (html and the offline coding in Visual Studio Code). 

<br> In any case, my final will function as a pipeline that connects the curious average joe to a vast world of storytelling. It will serve as a reference point to the artform I love and relate to most. It will be casual and functional but also dazzling, and I hope I can create a code that can adequately replicate this.
